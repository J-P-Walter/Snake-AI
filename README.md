SNAKE AI

Project using Q-Learning since the assignment for HCR didn't seem to work. 

Can absolutely be optimized in some way, probably by tweaking the numbers a bit. I ran for 300 episodes with a 3000 move cutoff. The snake never ran out of moves and
eventually got pretty good so the last 100 or so took a while. Highest score achieved while training was 71.
